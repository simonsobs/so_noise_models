SO Lensing noise curves
=======================


lensing_v3_0_0 (published)
--------------------------

Generated by Nam Nguyen using github.com/msyriac/orphics.
Based on v3.0.0 of the SO component separated noise curves.

lensing_v3_1_0 (recommended)
----------------------------

Generated by Toshiya Namikawa.
Based on v3.1.0 of the SO component separated noise curves.


NOTE: The differences between the above two versions are very minor.
Also, cross-correlation forecasts in the SO forecast paper
used a different set of `gradient-cleaned' curves which are
not included here, but the differences of those from v3_0_0
are also very minor.
